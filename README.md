# job-schedular-homework
This program reads information about jobs from two .txt files and assign jobs to the resources with using node based minheap structure.
In jobs.txt every line represents a moment, the arrival time of the job whose information is given at that line as 'job id <space> jobs duration'.
In dependencies.txt dependencies between jobs are given with job ids.
My comment lines are written both in english and turkish.:')
'given methods' was obligatory, I add my methods under them.
There is four inner classes in job schedular: resource, job, minheap (has the inner class node),and arraylist.
